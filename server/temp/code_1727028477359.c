Sure! Here is the C code for adding two numbers with hardcoded inputs:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 10;
    int sum = num1 + num2;

    printf("Sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, sum);

    return 0;
}
``` 

You can simply copy and paste this code into your C compiler and run it to see the output.
